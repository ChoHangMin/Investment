The decision is based on the judgment that it has reached the right time to buy as secondary battery stocks have been adjusted through the theme stock market that has been disrupted in August. According to Korea Investment Trust Management on the 7th, 'ACE Secondary Battery & Eco-friendly Tea Active', a secondary battery active ETF, will adjust its portfolio in September and incorporate LG Chem (051910), LG Energy Solution (373220), and SK Innovation (096770). As a result, 8 battery-man stocks accounted for 72.75% of ACE secondary batteries and eco-friendly cars.  Despite rumors in the market that the secondary battery craze has already passed, Korea Investment Trust Management has started to expand its inclusion in secondary stocks through portfolio adjustment because of the decline in investment in secondary stocks after August. Considering the characteristics of active ETFs that seek excess performance compared to the market, it is judged that they have selected secondary stocks to include stocks that can rise a lot in the future.  KOSDAQ market leader EcoPro BM (247540) stock price hit a new high of 462,000 won in July, but fell below 400,000 won in August as stock market funds flocked to superconductors, Maxine and artificial intelligence (AI) theme stocks. As of 10:00 a.m. on the 7th, it is currently trading below 300,000 won.  In particular, battery cell companies such as LG Energy Solution and SK Innovation, which were incorporated this time, have been evaluated as having high valuation, but they seem to be relieving such burdens due to the recent decline. Currently, electric vehicle sales are on the decline due to China's economic downturn, but considering that carbon neutrality centered on Europe and the U.S. is expected to continue, it is analyzed that long-term of secondary battery stocks is possible.  ACE Secondary Battery & Eco-Friendly Vehicle Active is also characterized by an even 9 percent range of 8 battery managers. LG Chem (9.18%), new nanomaterials (121600), EcoProBM (247540) (9.13%), LG Energy Solutions (9.12%), EcoPro (086520) (9.09%), SK Innovation (9.07%), POSCO Holdings (9.02%), and POSCO (9.00%) are the most important stocks in ACE secondary battery and eco-friendly differential activities.  As the ACE secondary battery & eco-friendly vehicle active stock cap (limited to the upper limit of market capitalization) is 10%, eight stocks recommended by the battery manager are expected to rise similarly.  An official from Korea Investment Trust Management said, \"In principle, ACE secondary battery & eco-friendly vehicle active ETF adjusts its portfolio about once a month,\" adding, \"The big feature is that this month's portfolio adjustment includes finished battery cell companies such as LG Energy Solution and SK Innovation.\"  He then explained, \"We still maintain a relatively high proportion of shares of POSCO Group-affiliated companies, which were relatively excellent factors among secondary battery-related ETFs.\"  [E-Daily Reporter Moon Seung-yong]",
